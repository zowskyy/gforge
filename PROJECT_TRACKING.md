# Project Tracking — Godot Forge

## Purpose

Godot Forge is a deterministic, version-aware, transaction-safe production
workbench for building and maintaining Godot games. It orchestrates VS Code,
the Godot engine, GDScript Toolkit, and GUT around a single project contract
rather than replacing them. This repository currently contains **Phase 1: the
Core CLI** — workspace detection, engine discovery, structured configuration,
versioned JSON output, stable exit codes, and the golden 2D fixture that every
later subsystem is validated against.

## Build Order (locked decisions)

- Independent repository at `C:\Users\thewi\Projects\godot-forge` (outside the
  accidental Desktop git repo).
- `uv` workspace, Python 3.12.
- Click shell over a framework-neutral core (`godotforge_core` never imports Click).
- Golden 2D fixture seeded in this phase.

## Open Dependencies

- Godot 4.7.1-stable.mono (console executable) — discovered via `FORGE_GODOT_PATH`
  or `PATH` during doctor; pinned in `fixtures/golden-2d/.godotforge/project.lock`.
- Later phases depend on this Phase 1 foundation: project graph (Phase 2),
  runner (Phase 3), diagnostics (Phase 4), patch engine (Phase 5), feature
  manifests (Phase 6), knowledge packs (Phase 7), Godot-native ops (Phase 8),
  VS Code (Phase 9), providers/CI (Phase 10).

## Known Gaps

- SARIF serializer emits a valid empty document; `rules`/`results` enrich in Phase 4.
- Provider entry-point discovery (`godotforge.providers`) deferred to Phase 10.
- `fixtures/cases/*` contain only documented breakage; the parser/lint that
  detects them lands in Phases 2–4.
- `--engine` global is wired into `doctor` but not yet consumed by later phases.
- Golden 2D fixture (`FIXTURE-0001`) not yet seeded; fixture-dependent
  read-only integration test deferred to that patch.
